# EDX CS50 Harvard's AI with python Projects

Course Link:- https://cs50.harvard.edu/ai/

This course explores the fundamental concepts and algorithms of modern artificial intelligence, including those that power game-playing engines, handwriting recognition, and machine translation. Through hands-on projects, students gain exposure to the theory and application of graph search algorithms, classification, optimization, reinforcement learning, and other topics in AI and machine learning, which they incorporate into their own Python programs. By the end of the course, students have experience with machine learning libraries and knowledge of AI principles that enable them to design their own intelligent systems.
This course project is a valuable resource for teaching AI in universities, preparing students for examinations, and supporting university projects.I had taught and studied this projects in university, while taking cs50 AI course as a reference.
